## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub

### Code Style

    Follow existing code style and conventions.

    Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.

    Keep functions focused and concise.

    Comment your code where necessary, especially complex or non-obvious parts.

    The library is header-only â€” please keep it that way.

### Commit Messages

    Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").

    Be concise but descriptive.

    Reference relevant issues if applicable (e.g., Fixes #123).

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or want to request a feature:

    Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.

    Create a new issue with a descriptive title and detailed explanation.

    Include code samples or screenshots if helpful.

### Testing

Currently, this project may not have automated tests (adjust if you add tests).
Please manually verify that your changes do not break existing functionality.
